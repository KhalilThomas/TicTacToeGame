    "### Brief explanation of what Tic Tac Toe is:\n",
    "\"Tic Tac Toe\" or Naughts & crosses is a game that is comprised of X's and O's, in order for a player to win the game they need to get exactly 3 of their value in a row, this can either be diagonally, horizontally or vertically. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How the program should work:\n",
    "1)The program should output a grid which the player can interact with\n",
    "2)The player should be able to input a value into one of the 3x3 squares\n",
    "3)The program should output an updated grid with the values on at each user input interval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules:\n",
    "1)A value cannot be put in a square that is already occupied\n",
    "2)The players need to take it in turns to play the game\n",
    "3)The players cannot go outside of the grid\n",
    "4)In order to win you have to get three values in a row\n",
    "5)If neither player gets 3 in a row, it is a draw"
